  <p>The numbers of female victims of Domestic Violence in West Harlem show a significant difference in contrast to male victims. </p>

      <div class="container">

      <p>Today, 77 percent of reported domestic violence cases are induced by an intimate partner or family member from Latinx and African American women. In comparison to 2019, those numbers dropped by 115 cases in the areas of Morningside Heights and Hamilton Heights, as stated in the annual report made by the domestic violence fatalities revision committee. And although anti-domestic violence organizations celebrate these numbers, not everyone does.</p>

<p> Lee Price, a lawyer with "Safe Horizon," the nation's leading victim assistance organization, says, "those numbers mean nothing. I see cases all the time of women who are suffering and can't escape."
  She states that Covid-19 has represented more significant challenges for victims to leave a dangerous situation and report them.</p>
<p> The difference in numbers between male vs female victims is clear. And sex offenses along with violations of protective orders represent the two biggest reasons for victims to report a case.</p>

<p>Karina Bernabe, executive director of "Nuevo Amanecer," a non-profit that serves women in West Harlem who are experiencing domestic violence, says that "the government needs to provide more safety measures." ... "Whether these methods are in-person or virtual, women's safety should be a priority, they [government] do that, and we'll see numbers drop."</p>
